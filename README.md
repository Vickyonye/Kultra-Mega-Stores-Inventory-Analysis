# 📈 KMS Sales Analysis – Power BI + SQL Case Study

## 📝 Project Overview
KMS, a global retail company, aims to improve its sales performance, profitability, and logistics by analyzing customer orders across regions, product categories, and shipping methods. This case study uses **SQL for data extraction** and **Power BI for visualization** to deliver actionable business insights.

As a Business Data Analyst, I used SQL to query and clean sales data, and then built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to support management’s decision-making.
